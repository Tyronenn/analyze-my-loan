# Loan Calculator - Feature Enhancements and Improvements

## Suggested Features and Functionality

### 1. Save/Export Options

#### **Export the Amortization Table to CSV or Excel**
Allow users to export the amortization table to a CSV or Excel file, which they can use for external analysis.

- **Feature**: Add a button that lets users export the table data to a CSV file.
- **Implementation**: Use Python's built-in `csv` module or `pandas` to export to CSV/Excel.

```bash
pip install pandas openpyxl
```

Sample code for CSV export:

```python
import csv

def export_to_csv(self):
    file_path, _ = QFileDialog.getSaveFileName(self, "Save CSV", "", "CSV Files (*.csv);;All Files (*)")
    if file_path:
        with open(file_path, 'w', newline='') as file:
            writer = csv.writer(file)
            writer.writerow(["Month", "Monthly Payment", "Principal", "Interest"])
            for row in range(self.amortization_table.rowCount()):
                writer.writerow([
                    self.amortization_table.item(row, 0).text(),
                    self.amortization_table.item(row, 1).text(),
                    self.amortization_table.item(row, 2).text(),
                    self.amortization_table.item(row, 3).text()
                ])
```

### 2. Loan Summary Overview

#### **Add a Total Loan Summary Section**
Consider adding a summary of the **total loan cost** over time, including:
- Total amount paid (principal + interest).
- Total interest paid over the loan term.

This can help users understand the full financial impact of their loan.

```python
total_paid = loan_amount + total_interest_paid
summary_label.setText(f"Total Amount Paid: ${total_paid:,.2f}")
```

---

### 3. Prepayment and Extra Payments Options

#### **Allow Extra Monthly Payments**
Many users make extra payments toward their loan principal to pay off the loan faster and reduce interest.

- **Feature**: Add an input field for "extra monthly payments" to allow the user to specify an additional amount they plan to pay toward the principal every month.
- **Effect**: The amortization schedule and total interest paid will update accordingly, showing the reduced loan term.

You can add this feature as another slider or input box and modify the loan calculation to account for it.

```python
extra_payment = 200  # For example, extra $200 monthly payment
principal_payment[i] += extra_payment
remaining_balance -= extra_payment
```

---

### 4. Interactive Graph Improvements

#### **Hover Information on Graph**
Add interactivity to the graph so that when users hover over the graph, they can see exact details for each month, such as:
- Total interest paid by that month.
- Principal balance remaining.

This can be achieved using **Matplotlib's event handling** to capture mouse movements over the plot.

```python
def on_hover(event):
    if event.inaxes == self.ax:
        # Display information based on hover location
        # You can map the x-axis (months) to the corresponding principal/interest
```

---

### 5. Loan Comparison Mode

#### **Add Multiple Loan Comparison**
Allow users to compare different loan scenarios side by side. For example, they could compare a 15-year loan to a 30-year loan, or a loan with different interest rates, and see how the payments, interest, and total cost differ.

- **Feature**: Add a button to duplicate the current loan parameters and compare them with another set of parameters.
- **UI Suggestion**: You could add multiple plots to the graph to show side-by-side comparisons.

```python
# Plot multiple loan options on the same graph
self.ax.plot(np.cumsum(principal_payment1), label="Loan Option 1")
self.ax.plot(np.cumsum(principal_payment2), label="Loan Option 2")
```

---

### 6. Input Validation

#### **Validate User Inputs**
Add validation to ensure inputs are valid, and show error messages if necessary.

```python
def validate_input(value, min_value, max_value):
    try:
        val = float(value)
        if min_value <= val <= max_value:
            return val
        else:
            raise ValueError("Out of range")
    except ValueError:
        # Display an error message or reset to default
        QMessageBox.warning(self, "Invalid Input", "Please enter a valid value.")
        return None
```

---

### 7. Dark Mode Support

#### **Add Dark Mode Theme**
Provide an option for users to switch between light and dark themes for better accessibility and user comfort. This can be done using PyQt's built-in theming or by applying a custom stylesheet.

```python
app.setStyle('Fusion')
palette = QPalette()
palette.setColor(QPalette.Window, QColor(53, 53, 53))
palette.setColor(QPalette.WindowText, Qt.white)
app.setPalette(palette)
```

---

### 8. Loan Type Options

#### **Support for Different Loan Types**
Add options for different types of loans (e.g., interest-only loans, balloon loans, or adjustable-rate mortgages). This would require adjusting the loan calculation logic depending on the loan type selected by the user.

- **Feature**: A dropdown menu (QComboBox) to let users select the loan type.
- **Effect**: Adjust the loan calculations based on the selected loan type.

```python
loan_type = self.loan_type_combobox.currentText()  # Get selected loan type
if loan_type == "Interest-Only":
    # Modify the calculation to show interest-only payments for a specified period
```

---

### 9. Interest Rate Variation

#### **Add Variable Interest Rates**
Allow users to input future interest rate changes over the loan term. For example, in an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), interest rates can change over time.

- **Feature**: Add a feature that allows users to input when the interest rate changes and by how much. 
- **Effect**: Adjust the amortization schedule based on the new rates after specific periods.

---

### 10. Help/Instructions Panel

#### **Add Help Section**
Provide a built-in help or instructions section explaining how the calculator works, what each field represents, and basic concepts like principal and interest. This could be a separate tab or a pop-up window.

```python
QMessageBox.information(self, "Help", "This is a loan calculator to estimate monthly payments, interest, etc.")
```

---

### 11. More Detailed Loan Summary (Pie Chart)

#### **Add a Pie Chart for Principal vs. Interest**
In addition to the amortization table and repayment graph, add a pie chart showing the total amount paid toward the principal vs. the interest, helping the user visualize how much goes toward interest payments over the life of the loan.

```python
self.ax.clear()
self.ax.pie([total_principal_paid, total_interest_paid], labels=["Principal", "Interest"], autopct="%1.1f%%")
self.canvas.draw()
```

---

### 12. Mobile/Desktop Cross-Platform Support

#### **Consider a Responsive Design**
Make sure the app adjusts well to different screen sizes and resolutions. If you plan to extend the app for mobile devices, consider using **Kivy** or **PyQt for Android** and **iOS** compatibility.
